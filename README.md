# App Store Analysis - Using Data Analytics to Inform Business Strategy

### A Data Analysis Project by Gagan Kaul

The company XYZ is in the business of building Android and iOS mobile apps. These apps are free to download and install, and they are distributed through Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.

The company's main source of revenue is in-app advertising. This posits the business model as volume driven - scale in terms of the number of users becomes very important. The more the number of users who see and engage with the ads, proportionally better is the revenue opportunity.

The senior management team is meeting for the annual strategy event to decide on allocation of resources and future app development roadmap. The team is seeking inputs from the business strategy group that will help the company maximize return-on-investment(ROI) opportunities.
